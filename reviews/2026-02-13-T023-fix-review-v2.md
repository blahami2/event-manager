# Code Review: T023 CI Fix (v2 revised)

**Date:** 2026-02-13
**Reviewer:** code-reviewer (subagent)
**Task:** T023 – Manage Registration Page
**Scope:** Replace hardcoded test token to pass gitleaks secret scanning

## Patch Summary

Single-line change: `const VALID_TOKEN = "abc123def456"` → `const VALID_TOKEN = "test-token-12345678"`

## Review Checklist

| # | Check | Result |
|---|-------|--------|
| 1 | New token works as test fixture | ✅ Pass – used as prop and in assertions; value is arbitrary |
| 2 | Clearly-fake pattern avoids scanners | ✅ Pass – `test-token-*` prefix signals non-secret; no hex-like entropy |
| 3 | Test functionality maintained | ✅ Pass – 235/235 tests pass |
| 4 | Other hardcoded tokens in file | ✅ OK – `"newtoken123"` exists in mock responses but won't trigger `generic-api-key` (not a const assignment pattern) |
| 5 | Architecture rules compliance | ✅ No violations (F9, GIT6, GIT7 satisfied) |
| 6 | Verification rules compliance | ✅ lint, tsc, vitest all pass |

## Findings

No issues found. The fix is minimal, correct, and sufficient.

## Score: **95/100**

-5: Minor – could consider centralizing test tokens in `tests/fixtures/seed-data.ts` per TEST5, but this is a pre-existing pattern and out of scope for a CI fix.

## Verdict: **PASS**
